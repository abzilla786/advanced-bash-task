## Ls with GREP
the ls command is actually a list directory of contents, and the grep command is used to search for lines of text that match one or many regular expressions, and outputs only the matching lines. So in this case when you use the grep command in conjunction with ls it will print the contents of the list inside of the directory.

and example command of this would be:
```
Ls(1) -1 | grep(1) <file>
```
## PIPE
a pipe is a form of redirection (transfer of standard output to some other destination) that is used in linux and other Unix like operating systems to send the output of one command/program/process to another command/program/process for further processing.

## Ps AUX
ps: command is used to get detailed information about process running on Linux, Unix and BSD systems
A: The default behaviour of the 'ps' command is listing only current user processes. All other users owned processes will be not shown. 'a' options will print all other user processes too.
U: The default behaviour about showing process information will not print the owner of the process. But in most of cases the process owner data will very helpful. So we can use u option in order to show process owner.
X: 'ps' will show only terminal attached process by default. if we want to show other processes those not attached to the terminal we can use 'x' option.
